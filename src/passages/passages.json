            "passageText": "A bald eagle can have a wingspan of up to 8 feet and can live for over 25 years. Eagles make their nests at the tops of tall trees to keep their eggs safe. Their nests can be up to 9 feet wide. Baby eagles are called eaglets. When eaglets are about 12 weeks old, they learn to fly. They stay with their mother and father for about 8 more weeks as they learn to hunt. Eagles like to live near the water. A bald eagle can see a fish from up to a mile away. It can swoop down from the sky at 75 miles an hour and grab a fish right out of the water!",
